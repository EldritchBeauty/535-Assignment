This application will create a database on a local server. Will need a local server in order to work.

A multifunction MVC application I made for an assignment at TAFE. Its a webpage.

Functionality Includes: 
- It has a fully functional authorisation system with login and registration.
- A theme change button to swap the colour scheme of the whole application.
- A file uploader and image generator.
- Youtube video embed.
- Database generation and migration, automated population. Database also has authorisation applied.
- Users may create and save shopping lists, add and remove items to said shopping lists.

If, for some reason, you want to run this application, please know that you will need a server and SSMS for it to work. You might also run into trouble with 
the authorisation stuff.
